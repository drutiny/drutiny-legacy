title: .htaccess redirects
class: \Drutiny\Check\Apache\HtaccessRedirects
description: |
  When there are a large number of redirects in the `.htaccess` file
  they are all required to be loaded at run time during every request as Apache
  needs to analyze the contents so that it can make appropriate decisions about
  how to process the application and incoming requests. Redirect rules should be
  refactored to take advantage of regular expressions if possible. Otherwise the
  redirect module should be added to the site and all of the redirects in the
  `.htaccess` file should be moved into the Drupal site. Although
  these redirects will then require a Drupal bootstrap in order to fulfill the
  request, Varnish will be able to cache the redirect once it has been made once
   as long as there is a maximum age set on the site.
