title: Hide errors from screen (log only)
class: \Drutiny\Check\D8\ConfigCheck
description: |
  When PHP encounters an error, it can generate an error log and display a
  report on the screen. While these error messages can be helpful in debugging
  your site, they can be a security risk on a live site as they may reveal
  information about your server that can be used to compromise it.
remediation: Set the config system.logging:error_level to be 'hide'.
success: Errors are not shown on the screen.
failure: Errors are shown on the screen, currently set to log error_level.
parameters:
  collection:
    default: 'system.logging'
  key:
    default: 'error_level'
  value:
    default: 'hide'
